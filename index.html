  <p>(/ˈtɛlʊɡuː/;[6] తెలుగు, Telugu pronunciation: [ˈt̪eluɡu]) is a classical Dravidian language native to the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where it is also the official language. Spoken by about 96 million people (2022),[7] Telugu is the most widely spoken member of the Dravidian language family, and one of the twenty-two scheduled languages of the Republic of India.[8] It is one of the few languages that has primary official status in more than one Indian state, alongside Hindi and Bengali.[9] Telugu is one of the languages designated as a classical language by the Government of India. It is the 14th most spoken native language in the world.[10] Modern Standard Telugu is based on the dialect of erstwhile Krishna, Guntur, East Godavari and West Godavari districts of Coastal Andhra.[14]

    Telugu is also spoken in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and the union territories of Puducherry and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is also spoken by members of the Telugu diaspora spread across countries like United States, Australia, Malaysia, Mauritius, UAE, Saudi Arabia and others.[15][16] Telugu is the fastest-growing language in the United States.[17] It is also a protected language in South Africa and is offered as an optional third language in schools in KwaZulu-Natal province.[18] According to Mikhail S. Andronov, Telugu split from the Proto-Dravidian language around 1000 BCE.[19][20] The earliest Telugu words appear in Prakrit inscriptions dating to c. 4th century BCE, found in Bhattiprolu, Andhra Pradesh.[21][22] Telugu label inscriptions and Prakrit inscriptions containing Telugu words have been dated to the era of Emperor Ashoka (257 BCE), as well as to the Satavahana and Vishnukundina periods.[23][24] Inscriptions in Old Telugu script were found as far away as Indonesia and Myanmar.[25] Telugu has been in use as an official language for over 1,400 years[26] and has served as the court language for numerous dynasties in Southern and Eastern India, including the Eastern Chalukyas, Eastern Gangas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Qutb Shahis, Madurai Nayaks, and Thanjavur Nayaks.[31] It was also used as an official language outside its homeland, even by non-Telugu dynasties such as the Thanjavur Marathas in Tamil Nadu.[32]

   <p> Telugu has an unbroken, prolific, and diverse literary tradition of over a thousand years.[33][34] Pavuluri Mallana's Sāra Sangraha Ganitamu (c. 11th century) is the first scientific treatise on mathematics in any Dravidian language.[35][36] Avadhānaṃ, a literary performance that requires immense memory power and an in-depth knowledge of literature and prosody, originated and was specially cultivated among Telugu poets for over five centuries. </p>

English is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family, whose speakers, called Anglophones, originated in early medieval England on the island of Great Britain.[4][5][6] The namesake of the language is the Angles, one of the Germanic peoples that migrated to Britain after its Roman occupiers left. English is the most spoken language in the world, primarily due to the global influences of the former British Empire (succeeded by the Commonwealth of Nations) and the United States.[7] English is the third-most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish;[8] it is also the most widely learned second language in the world, with more second-language speakers than native speakers.

English is either the official language or one of the official languages in 57 sovereign states (such as India, Ireland, and Canada). In the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, it is the sole or dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law.[9] It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union, and many other international and regional organisations. It has also become the de facto lingua franca of diplomacy, science, technology, international trade, logistics, tourism, aviation, entertainment, and the Internet.[10] English accounts for at least 70% of total native speakers of the Germanic languages, and Ethnologue estimated that there were over 1.5 billion speakers worldwide as of 2021.[3]

Old English emerged from a group of West Germanic dialects spoken by the Anglo-Saxons. <p>Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from Old Norse, a North Germanic language.[11][12][13] Then, Middle English borrowed vocabulary extensively from French dialects, which are the source of approximately 28% of Modern English words, and from Latin, which is the source of an additional 28%.[14] While Latin and the Romance languages are thus the source for a majority of its lexicon taken as a whole, English grammar and phonology retain a family resemblance with the Germanic languages, and most of its basic everyday vocabulary remains Germanic in origin. English exists on a dialect continuum with Scots; it is next-most closely related to Low Saxon and Frisian.English is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family, whose speakers, called Anglophones, originated in early medieval England on the island of Great Britain.[4][5][6] The namesake of the language is the Angles, one of the Germanic peoples that migrated to Britain after its Roman occupiers left.

<p>
    Modern Standard Hindi (आधुनिक मानक हिन्दी, Ādhunik Mānak Hindī),[11] commonly referred to as Hindi, is the standardised variety of the Hindustani language written in the Devanagari script. It is an official language of the Government of India, alongside English, and it is also the lingua franca of North India. Hindi is considered a Sanskritised register[12] of Hindustani, which itself is based primarily on the Khariboli dialect of Delhi and neighbouring areas.[13]

Hindi is an official language in nine states (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand), and three union territories (Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Delhi, Chandigarh), and an additional official language in three other states - West Bengal, Nagaland, Mizoram.[14][15][16][17]</p>
<p> Hindi is also one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India.[18]

Apart from the script and formal vocabulary, standard Hindi is mutually intelligible with standard Urdu, which is another recognised register of Hindustani, as both Hindi and Urdu share a core vocabulary base derived from Shauraseni Prakrit (a descendant of Vedic Sanskrit).[19][20][21][22] Hindi is also spoken, to a lesser extent, in other parts of India (usually in a simplified or pidginised variety such as Bazaar Hindustani or Haflong Hindi).[14][15] Outside India, several other languages are recognised officially as "Hindi" but do not refer to the Standard Hindi language described here and instead descend from other nearby languages, such as Awadhi and Bhojpuri. Such languages include Fiji Hindi, which has an official status in Fiji,[23] and Caribbean Hindustani, which is spoken in Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana.[24][25][26][27]

Hindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world, after Mandarin, Spanish, and English.[28] </p>
<p>When counted together with the mutually intelligible Urdu, it is the third most-spoken language in the world, after Mandarin and English.[29][30] According to reports of Ethnologue (2022, 25th edition), Hindi is the third most-spoken language in the world when including first and second language speakers.[31]

Hindi is the fastest-growing language of India, followed by Kashmiri, Meitei, Gujarati and Bengali, according to the 2011 census of India.[32]
